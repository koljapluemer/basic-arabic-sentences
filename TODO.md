## must


## should

* introduce harder exercises more often the more the user gets right? Is there a research on how to do this ideally? But thinking about, this is such a trivial game mechanic (rarely done in SR though, maybe at the end of duolingo lessons is a *kind of* implementation of this...)

## could

* implement stats with a good pattern this time
* implement good mastery mechanic for numbers
- possibly lingers too long on a number? (think it's fixed)
* have a toggle for localstorage
* could also do leeches instead of only new exercises...although that's sort of how SR is supposed to work anyways...
