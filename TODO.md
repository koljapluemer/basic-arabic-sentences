## Should 

- find a kind of win celebration when finishing a sentence chapter
- interrupt queue practice if it's longer than n exercises
- give player some incentive to keep going
- progress bar does not count to 10 (it still uses the old, complicated system) - but I don't want to remove that before it's clear that the 10 limit is a good idea
- fix bug that exercise is skipped by the countdown from the exercise before

## Could 

- give a more fine-grained access control to supabase
- when learning new sentences, sometimes you get the same thing twice

## Done
- find a good UI layout for the card instead using no hierarchy and random styles all over the place
